# GenAI 102:AWS hands-on examples

This notebook serves as a set of hands-on examples to a [startup loft session](https://aws-startup-lofts.com/emea/e/4d5b4/ignite-innovation-aws-generative-ai-for-startup-success---session-2-innovation-unleashed-at-scale-powered-search-summarization-and-text-to-sql-applications-with-aws-genai-services)

## Repository Contents

* [RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)](./Bedrockception.ipynb): This folder contains a detailed guide to RAG, one of the critically acclaimed methods for generative AI. It incorporates instructional code snippets, alongside modern RAG techniques (rewrite-retrieve, HyDE...)

* [Summarization](./SpoilerAlert.ipynb): The summarization part provides experiential learning by walking you through a series of pilot projects which tackle real world problems using AWS and Chain of Density method.

* [Text to SQL](TextToSQL.ipynb): This section handles language understanding with LLM, specifically looking at text to SQL translations. This use-case explores the potential of conversational AI models, especially using ReAct framework.

## Creator's Note
My intention behind creating this repository is not only to share subject-matter knowledge but also to inspire a generation to understand and explore the immense potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence. My experience as a Senior Solutions Architect, coupled with my passion for generative AI, motivates me to spread awareness about this burgeoning field.

## Usage
The use-cases in this repository are scripted as Jupyter notebooks. You can either clone the repo to your local machine and follow along, or run the notebooks directly on SageMaker Studio.

⚠️ These notebooks might encounter dependencies troubleshooting issues. It is recommended to deploy them on SageMaker Studio, with a  _Data Science_ environment ⚠️


## Contributions
As AI is a fast-evolving field, your contributions are more than welcome - let's grow together! Feel free to clone, modify, raise issues, or suggest enhancements.

## Acknowledgements
I am deeply grateful to DoiT International for creating an environment conducive to learning and growth. Also, a huge shoutout to the open-source community and AWS for making exceptional knowledge resources accessible to the masses.
