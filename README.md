# AWS GenAI 102 Startup loft exampels 

This repository serves as an accompanying guide of hands-on examples to a [AWS startup loft session](https://aws-startup-lofts.com/emea/e/4d5b4/ignite-innovation-aws-generative-ai-for-startup-success---session-2-innovation-unleashed-at-scale-powered-search-summarization-and-text-to-sql-applications-with-aws-genai-services) delving into canonical generative AI use-cases.

## Repository Contents

* [RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)](./Bedrockception.ipynb): This folder contains a detailed guide to RAG, one of the critically acclaimed methods for generative AI. It incorporates instructional code snippets, alongside modern RAG techniques (rewrite-retrieve, HyDE...)

* [Summarization](./SpoilerAlert.ipynb): The summarization part provides experiential learning by walking you through a series of pilot projects which tackle real world problems using AWS and Chain of Density method.

* [Text to SQL](TextToSQL.ipynb): This section handles language understanding with LLM, specifically looking at text to SQL translations. This use-case explores the potential of conversational AI models, especially using ReAct framework.


## Usage
The use-cases in this repository are scripted as Jupyter notebooks. You can either clone the repo to your local machine and follow along, or run the notebooks directly on SageMaker Studio.

⚠️ These notebooks might encounter dependencies troubleshooting issues. It is recommended to deploy them on SageMaker Studio, with a  _Data Science_ environment ⚠️
